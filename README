My purpose here is to try and teach myself a little bit of oAuth integration using Twitter as a auth mechanism
for Flaskr.

I'm going to use Tweepy as my oAuth wrapper.

Originally I chose not to implement the callback and went with a manual verifier.  After some investigation I determined that I could use
a "localhost" callback url.  So I did.

The part that still flummoxes me is the authorization/authentication.  Each auth includes an explicit authorization of the app.

It would seem to me that you should only have to authorize an app once, and then login/authentication going forward.

I moved my consumer keys and other specific things to a settings_local.py that I did not submit to git hub.
