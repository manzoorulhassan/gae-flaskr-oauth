My purpose here is to try and teach myself a little bit of oAuth integration using Twitter as a auth mechanism
for Flaskr.  Because I only want to run this locally on my dev system I'm not going to implement the oAuth callback.  

I'm going to use Tweepy for my Twitter oAuth integration - e.g. punting on doing my own oAuth impl.

I know, less than the minimum...
